# Global Game Jam 2020

Project created for the global game jam 2020

## The Game

Four space heroines, must control their 20-second battery drones, to find the parts and fix their cookie machine.
Have fun in this competitive splitscreen game for up to 4 players, where each controls their 20-second battery-powered drones to collect lost objects on the stage that result in tools to repair the last cookie machine that will save you from hunger!
Each player will control a drone of space heroines that are represented by:

**Valentina Tereshkova**, a Russian cosmonaut who was also the first woman to go into space
**Amelia Earhart**, defender of women's rights and the first woman to fly alone across the Atlantic Ocean
**Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson**,  a mathematician, physicist and space scientist who has made fundamental contributions to aeronautics and space exploration in the United States
**Radia Joy Perlman**,  a computer scientist often referred to as the "mother of the Internet" for her invention of the Spanning Tree (STP) protocol
